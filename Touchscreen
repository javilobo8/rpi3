Hi, 

Following instructions will save tons of time for Raspberry Pi3 users who had purchased 
display like 5 Inch Touch Display from Waveshare which uses XPT2046 driver chip.
Tested with 5 Inch 800x480 and 4 inch IPS 800x480 displays.


0) In OS Jessie NO DRIVER REQUIRED! for XPT2046 or ADS7846 Touchscreen. Do not install original driver from Waveshare or any other driver announced as compatible. You will kill your Jessie for sure. At least Waveshare driver totally disables WiFi module functionality!!!

1 ) sudo nano /boot/config.txt
add
Code: Select all

dtparam=i2c_arm=on
dtparam=spi=on
dtoverlay=ads7846,penirq=25,speed=10000,penirq_pull=2,xohms=150
2) Create directory /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d and file 99-calibration.conf in that directory
Add the following into the file
Code: Select all

Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "calibration"
        MatchProduct "ADS7846 Touchscreen"
        Option "Calibration" "3853 170 288 3796"
        Option "SwapAxes" "1"
EndSection
3) REBOOT aaaaand, have fun!!!!!!

AAAAAND that is basically it!! I have moved the rest of old instructions to comment cause they are not needed any more

FAQ:

What else do i need?
Just to maintain the testing and supportability, I recommend you to perform the following installations:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libts-bin evtest xinput python-dev python-pip
sudo pip install evdev
sudo apt-get install -y xinput-calibrator

After those installations you will be able to test touch and other controllers and calibrate screen. 

What on screen keyboard for Raspberry Pi do you recommend?
As the onscreen keyboard I use xvkbd cause it is resizable and can be tuned
sudo apt-get install -y xvkbd

I did all instructions but touch does not work and reacts strangely. What can be the reason?
Please take a look at this thread: viewtopic.php?f=44&t=173993&p=1112311#p1112311

Can I have some screensavers and screen blanking controll?
yes you can
sudo apt-get install -y xscreensaver xscreensaver-data-extra xscreensaver-gl-extra
However, some screensavers may be buggy at RPI. And GL ones eat current so do not use them in battery operation mode.

What current are we talking about? How much will my Raspberry Pi drain from the battery?
RPI 2@900mhz+ Screen with backlight 650mA - 2.1A (>0.88A with GLMatrix full screen)
RPI 3@1200mhz + Screen with backlight 650mA - 2.9A (>1A with GLMatrix full screen)
